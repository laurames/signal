# Signal: Muse EEG headband interactive artwork

This is an interactive artwork using the [Muse2014 headband](https://choosemuse.com/muse/). The artwork is built on top of [MuseIO](http://developer.choosemuse.com/tools/available-data) to access data and [Muse command line tools](http://developer.choosemuse.com/tools/museplayer/command-line-options) to send data via OSC to [OpenFrameWorks](https://openframeworks.cc).
